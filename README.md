# Hands on Projects

Start working on a project by opening [project.md](project.md).
Complete all projects by executing every step in each project from
the textbook. For those steps listed in [project.md](project.md),
follow the specified instruction.

Look for the TODO comments (i.e. `<!-- TODO -->`) to see
where screenshots/responses are required.
Type your response in multiline code blocks for the questions being asked
in this worksheet to help the TA grade your assignment. For example:

```
Your answer here.
```

Screenshots should be stored in the [media](media) directory. 
When inserting pictures, use this format `![Alt text](media/file.png)`.
